I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree at the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the School of Cyber Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), advised by Prof. Ben Niu. I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Information Security from China University of Geosciences, Wuhan in June 2024, advised by Prof. Wei Ren and Associate Prof. Liping Zhang. 

**Hobbies & Interests:** Snooker, Chinese eight-ball, Singing, Traveling, and Art Design (currently exploring color theory).

Beyond research, I'm always up for making new friends and hearing about your own "little adventures" in life. If you're looking for a collaborator or just a kindred spirit to share stories with, I’d be happy to connect!
